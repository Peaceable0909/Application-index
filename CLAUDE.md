## UI conventions

- **No emoji as icons, ever.** Every icon in the interface is an SVG from `src/components/Icon.tsx` (`<Icon n="check" />`). Need one that is missing? Add a path to that file instead of typing a symbol or emoji into the markup. That includes check marks, crosses, stars, sparkles and arrows used as icons (plain arrows inside a sentence are fine).
- The only emoji allowed are ones people choose to send: the chat emoji keyboard, message reactions, call reactions and the sticker pack. They are message content, not interface.
- Text the app writes into chats ("Photo", "Voice call · 2:31") stays plain words. `src/lib/sysText.ts` shows older rows without their emoji prefix and draws call lines with an icon.
- Anything `position: fixed` (sheets, dialogs, toasts) must not sit inside an element that keeps a `transform` after its entrance animation, or it gets pinned to that element instead of the screen. Entrance animations on page containers use `backwards` fill, not `both`.
